 Project Overview
Spell checkers are useful utility programs often bundled with text editors. In this
project, you'll create a networked spell check server. The purpose of the
project is to gain some exposure and practical experience with multi-threaded
programming and the synchronization problems that go along with it, as well as with
writing programs that communicate across networks.
